## Test task for Intetics
#### Hello. I used json-server as backend. All filters and search done on backend, front just sending requests for it (but search queries are sent with delay). Also added some unit and e2e tests. Sure here still can be some optimizations and more detailed styling, etc. But i've relized that this is test task, so i did my best on tech side and can endlessly update the design (but that can be checked from other projects from portfolio). Any changes and decisions in this up we can discuss

### libs used: React, Redux, Next.js MUI, axios, debounce + json-server
